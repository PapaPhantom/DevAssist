*Clipboard history tool that makes accessing your clipboard history simple and easy.
*You can customize the text and window colours in the _Settings.ahk file, but button colour doesnt change in this version of autohotkey!

How-Too DevAssist
*Run the _Main.ahk and _ClipHistory.ahk files in the root folder. These are seperated in case you want to use one but not the other.
*This may populate a menu, close that menu and you are ready to start!
*You can also set this to run on PC startup if you want, you will need to do that manually though!
*Press F8 to open the DevAssist main menu
*Press CTRL+SHIFT and scroll the mouse wheel to cycle through all recently copied or cut text you have copied or cut since opening the Clip History tool
*Add any full size templates to your MY_TEMPLATES folder in the root AS .TXT FILES ONLY. The system only recognizes .txt, be careful with what you save!
*You can add a new Menu Item for additional dropdown menus for templates, if you do so be sure to add new templates to that new menu item folder that populates in the root!
*The process for adding new hotkeys is manual but read the instructions and you will be fine!
*May all your code be bug-free!
